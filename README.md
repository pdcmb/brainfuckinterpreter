## About Brainfuck
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, the language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

## Notes
Current memory overflow behaviour is set to wrap, so the pointer returns to 0.
